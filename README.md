## ðŸ”§ Behind the Scene

### ðŸ§  SEO and Rendering Method

This project uses a hybrid approach to rendering, with two types of pages:

- **Homepage** â€” Lists available posts.
- **Post Pages** â€” Show full post content.

The rendering methods used are:

1. **Static Generation** â€“ Prebuilt pages at build time.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** â€“ Pages built on client request.
3. **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** â€“ Pages built on the client-side.

For SEO and localization, a solution was devised:

- **Localized Pages** â€” Each locale has a statically generated page at build
  time (e.g., `/fr/<postID>`).
- **Generic URL** â€” A server-side rendered page handles locale redirects (e.g.,
  `/postID`).

This ensures SEO-friendly, locale-specific pages, avoids CMS fetching on
request, and keeps content available even with CMS issues.

### ðŸ§­ Context of the Making

The way we consume blog posts and articles has shifted in recent years. What was
once used to share resources and tutorials has been overtaken by AI chatbots
that deliver such information instantly.

It is, however, incorrect to assume blogs became irrelevant. I came across
incredible value in recent posts by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/),
[Nanda Syahrasyad](https://www.nan.fyi/), or
[Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/), which all share common
denominators:

1. Deep technical knowledge.
2. Openly opinionated viewpoints (based on experience).
3. Top-tier visuals and examples.

Essentially, the opposite of AI â€” which highlights tradeoffs on surface-level
subjects. Itâ€™s with these new principles in mind that I gave my old blog a
much-needed revamp.
